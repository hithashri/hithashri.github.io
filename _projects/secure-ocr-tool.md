Context
Decades of scanned documents were inaccessible due to non searchable formats, and external OCR tools posed data security risks.

Problem
How can legacy documents be digitized securely within enterprise infrastructure?

Approach
I developed and deployed an on premise OCR web application to convert scanned documents into searchable text.

Built a secure OCR processing pipeline hosted internally

Designed the system to work without exposing data to third party services

Deployed and managed the service within enterprise constraints

Tools and Technologies
Python, Flask, OCR, document processing, internal server deployment

Impact

Digitized large volumes of legacy documents securely

Improved information retrieval across teams

Established the first Python based deployment within the plant network
