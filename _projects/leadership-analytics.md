Context
Leadership relied on static dashboards to monitor operational KPIs, which limited flexibility and increased licensing costs. Decision makers needed faster access to insights without navigating complex dashboards.

Problem
How can operational metrics be made more accessible, flexible, and cost effective for leadership teams?

Approach
I built an internal conversational analytics system that allowed leaders to query real time production metrics using natural language.

Integrated with enterprise databases to fetch live operational data

Injected domain knowledge such as KPI definitions and formulas for accuracy

Designed backend APIs to serve analytics responses securely

Built a lightweight frontend to support intuitive interaction

Tools and Technologies
Azure OpenAI, SQL, Oracle Database, FastAPI, TypeScript, REST APIs

Impact

Enabled faster decision making through natural language insights

Reduced dependency on static dashboards and licensing costs

Increased leadership engagement with operational data
