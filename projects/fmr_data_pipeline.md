Context
Quality reports were generated as non readable PDFs, requiring manual inspection and slowing response times for defective parts.

Problem
How can machine generated PDFs be converted into structured, analytics ready data automatically?

Approach
I designed an OCR and data extraction pipeline to transform PDFs into structured datasets integrated with analytics tools.

Built an OCR pipeline to extract tabular data from PDFs

Classified parts as compliant or non compliant programmatically

Automated refresh and reporting for near real time visibility

Integrated outputs into BI tools for faster action

Tools and Technologies
Python, OCR, Pandas, Excel automation, Power BI

Impact

Eliminated manual data extraction

Improved response time for quality issues

Enabled real time visibility into defect trends
