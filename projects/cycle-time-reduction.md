Context
A calibration bench in a production line used 20 test points, creating a bottleneck and increasing overall cycle time. Expanding capacity required significant capital investment.

Problem
Can analytics be used to eliminate redundant testing while maintaining accuracy and quality standards?

Approach
I analyzed historical calibration data to identify relationships between test points and built a predictive model to estimate later stage measurements.

Performed exploratory data analysis to understand correlations and variance

Trained and validated a regression model to predict final test values

Worked with process engineers to validate results against quality thresholds

Proposed elimination of redundant test logic based on model confidence

Tools and Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit learn, Support Vector Regression, data visualization

Impact

Reduced cycle time by 9 seconds per unit

Improved productivity by 2.6 percent

Avoided large capital expenditure by removing the need for new test benches
